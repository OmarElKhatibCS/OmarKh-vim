# OmarKh-vim
Hello , this is my personal vim setup , It will be updated frequently based on my needs.
I will make sure to document every Plugin I add with example of usage case.
***
# Installation üì•
### neovim , vim , gvim
For sure we need vim or neovim installed <br>
in order to enable clipboard copy-pasting we need vim-gtk or vim-gtk3 <br> <br>
*Ubuntu*
```bash
apt-get install vim vim-gtk3 neovim 
```
*Arch Linux*
```bash
pacman -S vim vim-gtk3 neovim 
```
Also if you don't have python install it then install python support inside vim because some plugins need it <br>
```bash
pip install neovim vim
```
üí° : make sure that pip refer to python3 else try pip3 instead

üí° : if your not a root user you need to use sudo

üí° : to migrate vim to neovim check neovim help page

üí° : make sure you use last neovim for better experience

### Install OmarKh-vim
The Installation is aimed only for Linux users. <br>
The Installer will backup your old .vimrc file into .vimrc.back
```bash
git clone "https://github.com/OmarElKhatibCS/OmarKh-vim.git" OmarKh-vim
cd OmarKh-vim
sh install.sh
```
üí° : to auto remove Installation files clone it into /tmp folder , 
 or you can run ``` cd .. && rm -rf OmarKh-vim ```

to have icons enabled you need a font such as NerdFont or FiraCode check this [link](https://github.com/ryanoasis/vim-devicons#installation)  <br>
### Install Plugin Manager
Next we need to install the plug-vim
for Vim 8.xx :
```bash
curl -fLo ~/.vim/autoload/plug.vim --create-dirs \
    https://raw.githubusercontent.com/junegunn/vim-plug/master/plug.vim
```
for neovim :
```bash
sh -c 'curl -fLo "${XDG_DATA_HOME:-$HOME/.local/share}"/nvim/site/autoload/plug.vim --create-dirs \
       https://raw.githubusercontent.com/junegunn/vim-plug/master/plug.vim'
```
-- [Source](https://github.com/junegunn/vim-plug)

### Install Plugins
After the installation of the Plugin Manager we need to install Plugins
```bash
vim +PlugInstall
```
or Method 2 : you can launch vim then press ESC on your keyboard then type :PlugInstall and press enter <br>
üí° : It's normal if you used Method 2 to get errors first time we open vim because plugins are not Installed yet.

üí° : If a Plugin failed during installation press SHIFT+R to retry

***

[GoTests-vim](https://github.com/buoto/gotests-vim) Plugin need [GoTests](https://github.com/cweill/gotests) binary , Install it using
```bash
go get github.com/cweill/gotests/...
```

# Themes
this vim configuation came with a default theme <br>
But I have couple of other themes installed <br>
remove the following lines from .vimrc and replace them with what provided in docs of each theme
```vim
" Theme section
        syntax          enable
        colorscheme     pixelmuerto
```
üí° it's better to keep the comments
